## Commands

You can use the following commands to manage blacklists.

| Command             | Description                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `/blacklist add`    | Add an entity to a blacklist      |
| `/blacklist remove` | Remove an entity from a blacklist |
| `/blacklist check`  | Check if an entity is blacklisted |
| `/blacklist clear`  | Reset a blacklist                 |

## Command Access

By default, all commands and subcommands are restricted to users with the **Timeout members** permission.
You can modify this in the <DashLink route="?next=/command-config">dashboard</DashLink>.
There you can set whitelisted channels, roles and users as well as needed permissions - if nothing is configured, default permission checks apply.

<Aside type="caution">
  It is highly recommended to restrict access to the `clear` subcommand to prevent accidental or
  malicious removal of all blacklist entries.
</Aside>

## Blacklist Scopes

You can blacklist an entity for multiple scopes:

- Tickets
- Reports
- [Tags](/getting-support/using-tags/)

## Blacklisting Anonymous Users

If a user who created an anonymous ticket misbehaves and you want to prevent them from creating further tickets, you can blacklist them by the ticket ID.
Use the `/blacklist add` command and provide the ticket ID in the `ticket-id` option.

When blacklisting by ticket ID, the system will automatically extract the anonymous identifier from the ticket and add it to the blacklist.

## Changing an Entry

To update an entry, you can simply just use `/blacklist add` or `/blacklist remove` again with the same entity and provide the according scopes.

### Examples

<details>
  <summary>A user is blocked from creating `tickets` and you want to allow them to create `tickets` again</summary>

```plaintext
/blacklist remove target:123456789012345678
```

<Aside type="note" title="Info">
  Because the user was only blacklisted for one scope, the entry will be deleted directly.
</Aside>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>A user is blocked from creating `reports` and `tickets` and you want to allow them to create `tickets` again</summary>

```plaintext
/blacklist remove target:123456789012345678
```

You will be asked to select the scopes you want to remove.

<Aside type="note" title="Info">
  Because the user was blacklisted for multiple scopes, you can select multiple scopes to remove. If
  you select all scopes, the entry will be deleted.
</Aside>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>A user is blocked from creating `tickets` and you want to also block them from creating `reports`</summary>

```plaintext
/blacklist add target:123456789012345678
```

You will be asked to select the scopes you want to add as you also would if you add a new entry.

<Aside type="note" title="Info">
  If you select scopes that are already blacklisted for the user, those will be ignored
</Aside>
