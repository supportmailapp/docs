After a report is submitted, the bot will send a message in the alert channel configured by the server managers.

If enabled, moderators can take action directly from the report message using the buttons and select menus provided.  
If actions are disabled, you can still **Ignore** or **Resolve** the report manually. If actions are disabled is
can be configured that reports are automatically marked as resolved so the server's global report limit is not exceeded.

## Blocking users from creating reports
