This page contains quick steps to get SupportMail up and running for new users and server admins.

## What is SupportMail?

SupportMail is powerful Discord Modmail bot. It allows server staff to manage support tickets from users via Discord DMs rather than through channels in the server visible for the user.

## Main Features

- Modern commands and interactions: Slash and Context Menu Commands, Buttons, Modals, Select Menus
- Localization support for multiple languages
- Custom Tags (Snippets)
- [Dashboard](https://dash.supportmail.dev) for easy configuration
- 800+ servers which are relying on SupportMail for their support needs

## Terminology

| Term         | Description                                                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ticket\*     | A support conversation between a user and server staff                            |
| Panel        | A message with a button in a server for users to create tickets                   |
| Ticket Forum | A forum channel in a server where tickets are created as threads for server staff |
| Entity       | This is a general term for "can be a user or a roles" in SupportMail              |
| Modal        | The term for "form" in Discord                                                    |

\* Tickets are in the process of changing. In the future, tickets will be a backend concept for server staff only.
Users will experience support mostly as one continuous thread, rather than managing separate tickets.

## Getting Started (Finally!)

### 1. Add the bot to your server

<LinkButton href="https://supportmail.dev/invite" icon="external">
  Invite Bot
</LinkButton>

### 2. Set up your server

Make sure your server has [Community Enabled](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server).
This is needed because SupportMail needs to create a forum channel, which is only available in Community servers.

Make sure you have at least one role for staff members who will be handling support tickets.

### 3. Setup the Ticket Forum

Go to the [dashboard](https://dash.supportmail.dev?next=/ticket-settings?setup=true) and follow the steps to create your Ticket Forum.

Alternatively, you can also use the `/setup tickets` command in your server to set it up via Discord.
However this does not provide the full setup experience and only minimal configuration options.

After the bot set up the forum, you can add custom roles for staff members who will be handling tickets. This is done directly in Discord.
The bot's permissions in the Ticket Forum are managed by the bot and **shall not be changed manually**.

### 4. Make a Panel (optional)

The idea of modmail is, to reduce clutter in your server by removing public support
channels where users can see their tickets and a channel where they can create tickets.

However you might notice, that users might not know how to create tickets in the first place if your users are not the most "discord-savvy".

To solve this, you can create a Panel in your server. A Panel is a message with a button that users can click to create a ticket.

Currently, you can only create a Panel by using the `/config panel` command in your server.
This will be moved to the dashboard in the future with more options, providing a better user experience.

## Best Practices

- Make sure to inform your users about the new support system and how to create tickets.
- Set up ping roles and users for ticket notifications (Dashboard -> Ticket Settings -> Notifications).
- Briefly train your staff on how to use SupportMail effectively. The **Managing Support** category is a good reference.
  This is important if your staff is not familiar with modmail systems and/or Discord bots in general.

### Next Steps

- It is highly recommended to go through the rest of the configuration options in the [dashboard](https://dash.supportmail.dev).
- Read the [documentation](https://docs.supportmail.dev) to learn more about advanced features and configuration options.
- Test it out! You should try creating a ticket by sending a DM to the bot or using the Panel you created to ensure,
  that everything is working as expected and all permissions are set up correctly.

- Join the [SupportMail Discord Server](https://help.supportmail.dev) if you need help or want to give feedback.
