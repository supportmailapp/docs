This page contains quick steps to get SupportMail up and running for new users and server admins.

## What is SupportMail?

SupportMail is powerful Discord Modmail bot. It allows server staff to manage support tickets from users via Discord DMs rather than through channels in the server visible for the user.

## Main Features

- Modern commands and interactions: Slash and Context Menu Commands, Buttons, Modals, Select Menus
- Localization support for multiple languages
- Custom Tags (Snippets)
- [Dashboard](https://dash.supportmail.dev) for easy configuration
- 800+ servers which are relying on SupportMail for their support needs

## Terminology

| Term         | Description                                                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ticket\*     | A support conversation between a user and server staff                            |
| Panel        | A message with a button in a server for users to create tickets                   |
| Ticket Forum | A forum channel in a server where tickets are created as threads for server staff |

\* Tickets are in the process of changing. In the future, tickets will be a backend concept for server staff only.
Users will experience support mostly as one continuous thread, rather than managing separate tickets.

## Getting Started (Finally!)

### 1. Add the bot to your server

<LinkButton href="https://supportmail.dev/invite" icon="external">
  Invite Bot
</LinkButton>

### 2. Set up your server

Make sure your server has [Community Enabled](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server).
This is needed because SupportMail needs to create a forum channel, which is only available in Community servers.

Make sure you have at least one role for staff members who will be handling support tickets.
