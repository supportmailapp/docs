    "Tickets" as a concept are in the process of changing. I'm sorry for any confusion this may cause
    in the transition period.<br>In the future, tickets will be a backend concept for server staff only.
    Users will experience support mostly as one continuous thread, rather than managing separate tickets.

There are multiple way you can send messages to a sserver to contact support staff:

1. [Sending a DM to the Bot](#with-a-dm)
2. [Using a Panel](#with-a-panel)
3. [Using the `/create-ticket` command in a server](#with-a-command)

Note that you need to authorize SupportMail to access your Discord account to create tickets.
This is so that the bot can identify you from DMs and access your member information in servers more easily.

## With a DM

You can send a direct message to the bot to create a ticket. The bot will guide you through the whole process.

## With a Panel

Server Managers can set up a Panel in their server that users can interact with to create tickets.
The bot will then send you a DM which you can respond to in order to create the ticket in the server.

## With a Command

You can use the `/create-ticket` command to create a ticket. It is available in both DMs and servers.
When used in a server, the ticket will be created in that server. When used in DMs, you need to select the server you want to create the ticket in.
