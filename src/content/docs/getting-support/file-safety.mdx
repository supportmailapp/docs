SupportMail forwards only images and videos from the user's DM to a server, while other file types can be sent to the user from the server.
This design choice is made to enhance security and minimize the risk of malware or harmful files being transmitted through the support system and to protect both users and support agents.

<Aside type="caution">
  It's important to remain cautious as attackers can sometimes embed malware within seemingly
  innocuous files.
