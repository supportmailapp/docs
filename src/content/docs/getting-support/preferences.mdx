Preferences are settings that only apply to your discord user account. They allow you to customize your experience with SupportMail on a per-user basis.

## Available Preferences

| Preference             | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**           | Choose the language SupportMail uses to communicate with you.                                                                                                    |
| **Automatic Redirect** | If enabled and you have 1 or more open chats with servers, new messages you send to the bot's DM will automatically be sent to your most recently active server. |

## Changing Preferences

You can change your preferences using the `/preferences` command.

## Language

All available languages are: English, German, French

### Change Language

Use `/preferences language` to change the language SupportMail uses to communicate with you.

### How language is determined

#### Your language preference will be used in the following cases:

- You DM the bot and the bot responds to you.
- A serverteam replies back to you after you sent a message and the bot forwards this message to your DMs.[^1]
- You report a message or user and the report acknowledgment is sent to you.[^1]

#### Your language preference will NOT be used in the following cases:

- You interact with the bot via
  - Slash commands
  - Context menu commands
  - Buttons/Select menus
  - Modal (Form) submissions

## Automatic Redirect

When enabled, this preference will make SupportMail automatically redirect new messages you send to the bot in DMs to your most recently active server chat if you have 1 or more open chats.
This is useful if you frequently need to contact serverteams using SupportMail, as you don't need to confirm sending the message to the correct server each time.

<Aside variant="danger" icon="warning">
  If you have an open chat with a server and you want to send a message to a different server, you
  **need** use the command `/create-ticket` to create a new chat with that server.
</Aside>

[^1]: If the server has a language set, that language will be used if you don't have a language preference set.
