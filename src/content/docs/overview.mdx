Welcome to the SupportMail documentation!

## About SupportMail

SupportMail is powerful Discord Modmail bot. It allows server staff to manage support tickets from users via Discord DMs rather than through channels in the server visible for the user.

## Main Features

### Modmail

Users send a bot a direct message to contact the serverteam. The bot then creates a
so-called ticket post in the private ticket forum which is where the serverteam can respond.

The bot acts as a bridge between the user and the serverteam, forwarding messages between both sides.

### Reports

Users can report messages in the server using <Annotation annotate="Slash commands start with a forward slash (/) and let you trigger bot functions directly. You can browse them by clicking the little + icon on the left side in the chat bar for easy access.">slash commands</Annotation> or context menu commands.
