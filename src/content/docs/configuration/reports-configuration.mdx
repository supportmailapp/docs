## What are reports?

Reports in the context of a Discord bot are submissions made by users to notify server moderators of inappropriate behavior, messages, or activities within the server.

These reports help maintain community standards by allowing moderators to review and take appropriate action against violations, ensuring a safe and respectful environment for all members.

## The workflow

Before each report-process is started, the following data is checked:

- Is the author blacklisted?
- Is the user immune?
- Has the server, user, or author reached a limit?

## Report Limits

<div class="table-wrapper">

| Limit                          | Explanation                                                                    | Min / Max configurable | Default |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------- |
| Open reports a user can create | The number of reports that are still open and where the **author** is the user | 1 - 100                | 5       |
| Max open reports per user      | The number of reports that are still open and where the **target** is the user | 1 - 100                | 1       |
| Max open reports in the server | The number of open reports in the whole server                                 | 1 - 1000               | 20      |

</div>

_Limits for the limits may change when [SupportMail Diamond](https://supportmail.dev/premium) is introduced._

<details>
  <summary>Limits examples</summary>

**Example 1:**

- User A has created `5` reports that are still open.
- The "Open reports a user can create" limit is set to `5`.
- User A tries to create a new report.

<ArrowInline class="ml-4" /> User A cannot create a new report because they have reached the limit
of open reports they can create.

**Example 2:**

- User B has `3` open reports against them.
- The "Max open reports per user" limit is set to `3`.
- User C tries to create a new report against User B.

<ArrowInline class="ml-4" /> User C cannot create a new report against User B because User B has
reached the limit of open reports against them.

**Example 3:**

- The server has `20` open reports.
- The "Max open reports in the server" limit is set to `20`.
- User D tries to create a new report.

<ArrowInline class="ml-4" /> User D cannot create a new report because the server has reached the
maximum number of open reports allowed.

</details>

<Aside type="note">
  There are so-called "hard limits" which are hardcoded in the bot and cannot be changed in any way.

## Report Actions

Moderators can take actions on reports to manage and resolve them. The available actions include:

| Action                         | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ignore**\*                   | Dismiss the report without taking any action.<br />_implies that the report has been rejected_                                                    |
| **Resolve** (without action)\* | Mark the report as resolved after taking appropriate action on the reported issue.<br />_implies that the report has been handled in another way_ |
| **Timeout**                    | Timeout the user<br />[min-max: 10 seconds - 28 days](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413305239191-Time-Out-FAQ)                   |
| **Kick**                       | Remove the user from the server                                                                                                                   |
| **Ban**                        | Permanently ban the user from the server                                                                                                          |
| **Delete Reported Message**    | Delete the message that was reported                                                                                                              |

\* These actions are always available, even if you disable actions in the [Dashboard](https://dash.supportmail.dev?next=/report-settings).

## Immune Entities

You can configure certain users and roles to be immune from being reported. This means that reports against
these entities will show an error to the user trying to report them, indicating that they cannot be reported.

<Aside type="danger">
  However, if you have a larger team or do not know how they behave, we strongly recommend that you
  do not configure this setting to ensure that no one abuses their rights and breaks rules with
  impunity.
</Aside>

## Moderators

By default, everyone with at least **Timeout members** permissions can take action on a report.
Kick and ban require the user to also have the respective permission.

Mods also bypass the report limit you've manually configured. _(the hard limits still apply)_

## Special Channels

You can configure specific channels in your server to be excluded/included from reporting.

If you include channels, reports can only be created in those channels.  
If you exclude channels, reports cannot be created in those channels.

You cannot configured both at the same time - you need to choose one or the other.

<Aside type="note">
  By default, no channels are excluded or included, meaning that reports can be created in any
  channel.
