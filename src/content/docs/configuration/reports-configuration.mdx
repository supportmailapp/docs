## What are reports?

Reports in the context of a Discord bot are submissions made by users to notify server moderators of inappropriate behavior, messages, or activities within the server.

These reports help maintain community standards by allowing moderators to review and take appropriate action against violations, ensuring a safe and respectful environment for all members.

## The workflow

Before each report-process is started, the following data is checked:

- Is the author blacklisted?
- Is the user immune?
- Has the server, user, or author reached a limit?

_Limits for the limits may change when [SupportMail Diamond](https://supportmail.dev/premium) is introduced._

<details>
  <summary>Limits examples</summary>

**Example 1:**

- User A has created `5` reports that are still open.
- The "Open reports a user can create" limit is set to `5`.
- User A tries to create a new report.

<ArrowInline class="ml-4" /> User A cannot create a new report because they have reached the limit
of open reports they can create.

**Example 2:**

- User B has `3` open reports against them.
- The "Max open reports per user" limit is set to `3`.
- User C tries to create a new report against User B.

<ArrowInline class="ml-4" /> User C cannot create a new report against User B because User B has
reached the limit of open reports against them.

**Example 3:**

- The server has `20` open reports.
- The "Max open reports in the server" limit is set to `20`.
- User D tries to create a new report.

<ArrowInline class="ml-4" /> User D cannot create a new report because the server has reached the
maximum number of open reports allowed.
