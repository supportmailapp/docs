Most settings are applied globally. Granular settings can be configured in individual [ticket categories](/configuration/ticket-categories).

- **Status**: Ticket System is enabled or disabled
- **Pausing**: Pause ticket creation globally indefinitely or for a set time period/until a specific date (up to 1 month)
- **Ticket Forum**: The forum where tickets are created in
- **Automatic Forwarding**: Whether replies in ticket posts are automatically forwarded to the user
- **Allowed Bots**: Bots are usually ignored in ticket posts. Allow up to 5 bots that will not be ignored.
- **Pings**: A list of entities (roles/users) that will be pinged when a new ticket is created
- **Anonymous Replies**: When enabled, every reply from the staff will be anonymously sent to the user, hiding the staff's identity.
- **Anonymous Tickets**: You can allow users to open tickets without revealing their identity.
- **Default Creation & Close Message**: These are used when creating or closing tickets and nothing else is set.

Read the god damn descriptions in the dashboard please... Then you wouldn't need to read this.

## Commands

Although most settings are configured in the dashboard, some can also be configured via commands:

### Pausing the ticket system

`/config pause`  
`/config resume`

Pause or resume ticket creation (existing tickets are not affected)  
Use a [timestring](/guides/timestrings) when providing a duration. It can also be a [unix timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/)
