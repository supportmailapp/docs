Managers can configure feedback collection settings to gather insights from users after their support tickets are resolved. This feedback helps improve service quality and user satisfaction.

However there are a few side effects to be aware of when enabling feedback collection:

- The user will receive a notification once their ticket is closed, prompting them to provide feedback.  
  This interrupts with the usual flow of ticket closure - usually the user won't receive any notification
  that their ticket has been closed because they don't even see "Ticket Created".
- Feedback responses are stored in the database and can optionally be sent in a channel - the discord message will contain an attachment with the feedback details because of potential length.

## Configuration

To set this up go in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.supportmail.dev?next=/feedback) and navigate to the "Feedback" section.

There you can configure all possible settings:

- **Enable Feedback Collection**: Toggle to enable or disable feedback collection for closed tickets.
- **Feedback Channel**: Specify a channel where feedback responses will be sent. If left blank, feedback will only be available in the dashboard when you view a ticket's details. _Analytics and an overview will be added in the future._
- **Thank You Message**: Customize the message users see after submitting their feedback.
- **Feedback Questions**: Define form fields to collect specific information from users. You can various types of fields: text input, text display and a select menu with predefined options.

## User Experience

When feedback collection is enabled, users will receive a message in their direct messages after their ticket is closed. This message will contain the feedback form with the configured questions.
